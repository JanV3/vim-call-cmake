vim-call-cmake
==============

Create out of source build dir, call cmake and set makeprg variable

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch.git

## Usage

Set current directory which contains root CMakeLists.txt and run `CMake`
